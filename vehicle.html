        	<h4>Range Rover Sport</h4>
        	<p>The Range Rover Sport is powered by a supercharged 5.0-litre Supercharged all-aluminium Jaguar engine AJ-V8 producing 510 hp (380 kW) and 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft). A naturally aspirated 4.4-litre variant produces 300 hp (224 kW) and 425 N⋅m (313 lb⋅ft) and has been adapted by Land Rover with a slightly greater capacity and increased torque. Both petrol engines have been designed with a sump and oil pick-up system to allow for operation at extreme angles. Due to lack of popularity, the naturally aspirated power plant was omitted from the UK market in 2007. The advanced 2.7-litre turbodiesel TDV6 is an adaptation of the PSA/Ford development and produces 190 hp (142 kW) and 440 N⋅m (325 lbf⋅ft) in Land Rover guise. It features a compacted graphite iron block and aluminium cylinder head with fast switching piezo crystal injectors. Debuting in both the Sport and the flagship Range Rover in 2007 was the 3.6-litre twin turbodiesel TDV8.</p>

        	<h1>Range Rover Velar</h1>
        	<p>The Range Rover Velar ushers in a new design language for Land Rover that is influenced by Land Rover's previous design language that began with the Evoque and most recently was used in the Range Rover Sport. The new design language features smoother lines on the body, and emphasises sportiness and on-road ability, but more important is the new interior design language that begins with the Velar, which will later spread to other Range Rover models. The interior of the Velar is influenced by that of the I-Pace of 2018 and features 3 touchscreens, which control most of the interior features of the Velar. The cockpit of the Velar is more driver-focused and the seating position is lower than any other Land Rover before, as sportiness and on-road performance are top priorities.</p>
